    Before we went to Acadia National Park and Bar Harbor, we spent three days in Portland. Portland was lovely. They had wonderful food, a great shopping disctrict, and was close enough to other cool towns like Kennebunkport, Cape Elizabeth, and Freeport.
    We went whale watching in Kennebunkport. There were Finback Whales and a Sunfish! We saw their tails and also go to sleep! It was awesome to see them just float along in the current while they slept. In Cape Elizabeth we got to see the lighthouse. The beach near there got a lot of spiders. Freeport was a close second to Kennebunkport, but that's cause I like to shop. They had a cool outlet mall and an LL Bean Campus. It had different buildings with different products, it was a bit overwhelming. Freeport also had a really cool chocolate shop where you could see them make the chocolate!
