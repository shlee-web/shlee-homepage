        The very first vacation my family went on was to see my aunt and cousins in Florida. My other aunt's family and my family drove down and we stayed at her house. The beaches were lovely, we went to the Navarre Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Center, and we went to Destin and were on a pontoon for the whole day. We also went kayaking in the ocean and saw a turtle come up! It was a very fun time.
