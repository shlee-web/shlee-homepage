        The Stibbert Museum was on of the many amazing places I visited in Florence. It was quite the walk to get there. We always met on campus when we went on a field trip for class, which was a 25 minute walk for me and then we had to walk another 30 minutes to get to the museum. There was a really steep hill before the museum, so it was tiring but absolutely worth it. There were European, Japanese, and Arabic collections of armor. The museum and the collection was originally started by Frederick Stibbert who inherited his grandfather's wealth and just collected armor for the rest of his life.
