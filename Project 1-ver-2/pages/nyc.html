        This trip was earlier this year and my first time in NYC. I went with the student publication I was an illustrator for called PWATEM. The trip was paid for by the school and I was even given a stipend! We went to attend an event for comics artists and illustrators called MoCCA. It was amazing to see so many amazing artists sell awesome books and interact with them.
        The lyft from the airport to the hotel was a little scary. The driver squished four people into the backseat instead of setting up the third row in the back. No one could wear any seatbelts except the front passenger, and the driver just chose to not wear his seatbelt. He was speeding and not slowing down for speed bumps. Quite the ride.
