        It was a very short visit to the vatican but it was still pretty amazing. I think we were there for maybe an hour or two. I saw a Jollibee there which made me smile, and then discovered that there were a lot of Filipinos there! When I went into a shop to get a rosary for my grandma, the associates were both Filipino, so I got to practice my Tagalog with them but I'm not fluent in it and neither was one of the associates.
