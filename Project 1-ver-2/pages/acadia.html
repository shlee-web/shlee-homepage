        My family had been wanting to go to Maine for a while, and this is the first trip without other family members with us. Acadia National Park was a breathtaking place. We decided to drive around and just stop everytime we could to look at the view, so I decided to wear a long flowy skirt. I was not prepared for my brother to want to hike down Cadillac Mountain a bit to get a different view. I had to hike up and down with my long skirt, and people looked at me weird but I still did it.
