<h1>The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement</h1>

Utopias as a concept have been more dystopian to me. I always associate utopias with clean, minimal, and controlled. With control being out of our hand to maintain the clean and minimal environment of utopias. I think the lack of freedom is what makes it dystopian. Everything matching, the lack of creativity, and individuality will be the death of us as a society. I think the closest thing I can think of that is similar to this idea is Aunt’s neighborhood. She lives in an upper middle class neighborhood with a HOA. There seems to be only 4 models of houses, the same type of mailbox with the same color, and limits on what you can have in the front and back yard. Environments like this that restrict individuality and enforce uniformity is restricting and truly the closest thing to a “utopia” to me.

<i>As it turns out, the cloud is more of a marketing buzzword than an accurate description of file storage. Though it may not be on your hard drive, all information must be saved physically somewhere on the network. “There is no cloud, it’s just someone else’s computer.”</i>

I figured there had to be something physical when it came to the cloud. Like an actual file cabinet and not an endless hall that can continuously expand when I throw more money at the company. It is mentioned later in the reading that Masanobu Fukuoka believed that understanding nature was necessary for agriculture, and the author believes the same should be applied to technology. I agree with this, but I think our generation and generations after will have a basic understanding of technology even as it continues to innovate and change. Newborns are basically born with an ipad at this point.
