<h1>A Friend is Typing</h1>
<p>
With technology being used as a main way of communication for some, our language has changed to optimize getting our message across quickly. From abbreviations to using emojis to react to something. <br><br>
I don’t like the name “the throbber.” Although it does accurately describe the movement of an ellipses. It just disturbed me. <br><br>
To be completely honest, this reading was a bit difficult. I feel like discussing this reading with the class and listening to everyone was better for me. One thing that did catch my attention was “You are the Product.” I’ve heard it a couple times before. I never really understood until recently. Like, of course this app where I can interact with my friends, follow creators, and share my own art and bits of my life isn’t just from the graciousness of the developers’ hearts. Advertisements are inescapable now and more in our face now and our data sold to companies. It’s a little scary if I think about it too much. We think we have privacy and privilege of anonymity behind the screen when that cannot be more untrue. I think about Pokemon Go and how it’s a task to record your surroundings in order to receive a great in-game item. Then it came out that Niantic uses that to train AI for map building based on the world. Just a little scary thought.
