<h1>My Website is a Shifting House</h1>
<p>
This reading really made me think about the term “handmade.” Like it was mentioned in the reading, handmade is usually associated with crafted items like crocheting clothing, DIY items, or being a craftsman. I always associated it with being something tangible and not digital, so it's interesting to call this handmade to me. It definitely is, I just was not ready to be put in that perspective.

This is an interesting thought. I think it is expected for professionals to have a website, like artists and business owners. For artists, a website is expected to act as a portfolio so it wouldn’t be odd for me to have a website. But if a person just had a website like someone would have an instagram account nowadays, that would make it a bit hard to always catch up with people. Just a funny thought.
