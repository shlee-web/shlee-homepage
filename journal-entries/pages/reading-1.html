<h1>My Website is a Shifting House</h1>
<p>
    The biggest thing that stood out to me when I read this was the analogy of a website being a garden. The author mentioned seasons and different plants thrived in different seasons. It just made me think of my practice as an artist and how often my work evolves. As my environment changes, I change too. From the people around me, things I obsessed over, and to things that are going on in the world; my work will change and just like a garden with different seasonal flowers, my website will present something new and different each season. It will be a forever project that will grow and evolve with me. A website is not only a garden, a shelf, or a collection of webpages, but it can be a reflection of me and my artistry.
