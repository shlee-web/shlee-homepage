        <h1>Rome</h1>
        <p>
        Rome was a quick day trip. I skipped my classes this day to hang out with Nicole Killian and the GDES students. It was an amazing day trip. We saw the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain, and went to the Vatican! Walking around Rome was awesome. Sometimes you would just pass by some ruins. This was probably one of the coolest places I went to in Italy.
