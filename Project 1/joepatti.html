        <h1>Joe Patti</h1>
        <p>
        This was also bought in Florida. Everytime we visit Florida, we stay with my aunt in Navarre. Its a small town that's close to Pensacola and Destin. There are beautiful beaches and delicious seafood. One of my favorite places to go to there is Joe Patti. It's a fish market with fresh fish and the best crab dip I've had (sorry Maryland).
