        <h1>Florence</h1>
        <p>
        There's a lot to say about Florence. I spent a whole month there for a study abroad program. I feel like it was such an amazing experience and its crazy that it was only a few months ago. My classes were awesome. I took Discovering Florence, where we basically explored Florence everyday. And my other class was Sketchbook Studies, and we went to castles, gardens, and churches to sketch the architecture. Both of my classes were basically explore Florence to the max. <br>
        My favorite moment has got to be my birthday. I got the best roommates when I went to Italy. I got home late because my class went to an opera (amazing experience as well). When I opened the door to my apartment, there were sticky notes leading to the living room and they decorated the place with balloons and streamers. They got me a slice of cake and sang happy birthday. Even though they were really sleepy they stayed up for me. Truly a great memory. <br>
        I think a close second would be us getting locked out the first night in Florence, but that's a story for another time haha.
