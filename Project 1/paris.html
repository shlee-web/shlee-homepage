        <h1>Paris</h1>
        <p>
        The day after visiting Rome, I had a flight to Paris so I had to miss my classes that day too. It was my first flight alone. I was a bit navigating an airport alone but I was okay. It was Charles De Gaulle airport that was more nerve wracking since I didn't want to pay 30 euros to get to Paris, I had to take the train. I had to trust the signs and make sure I got a ticket. It only took me 10 minutes to get to the train station from the airport. The train was bumpy and long, and I had to go up so many escalators to get outside but I finally met up with my aunt and cousins. I got a cousin that lives there so I stayed with her, while my aunt and other cousin stayed at a hotel. <br>
        As much as I loved Italy and the food there, I just fell inlove with French food. It was amazing. We had a dinner cruise along the Seine, and saw so many cool monuments. We also took a tour bus earlier that day, but it was cool to see it at night too! Even though I was only there for a weekend, it was still an awesome time.
