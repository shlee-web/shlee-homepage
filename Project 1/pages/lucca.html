       Lucca is a beautiful town an hour away from Florence. Like all of Italy, it has beautiful historical structures. Surrounding the town are large walls from the medieval period! We visited Lucca while I was studying abroad in Italy. It was a challenge to get there because the buses for our group never arrived, so the school had to get us taxis and we got there two hours later than everyone else. Fortunately we still had more than enough time to explore the town! The roads were narrow, and it always surprised me how the drivers there would try to squeeze their trucks and cars in alley ways. There was a French market where I got some macarons and some perfumes. They had a lot of cool local shops too, and I had some dessert from the oldest bakery there! A lot of musicians loved to busk around the chruches, so there was always beautiful music around. The town also had a renowned music school, so that made sense. If you're ever in Italy, try to visit Lucca!
