        We bought this the second time we went to Florida. There were more people coming this time, so we stayed at an AirBnb. Since there were four families during this trip, my uncle brought his rice cooker so we wouldn't dine out as much. We would all have braekfast at the AirBnb, and I only cooked for eveyone once. I helped prepared all the other times or just cooked one dish. <br>
        We all wanted steak, so we went to a walmart (the only supermarket this town had) and found this cool surfboard fridge magnet!
