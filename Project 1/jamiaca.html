        <h1>Jamaica</h1>
        <p>
        I have never been to Jamaica, but my roommate is Jamaican and she bought this for me when she went last year. She is the sweetest person ever and I'm so lucky to have her as a great friend and roommate. She knew I love fridge magnets and got the perfect gift for me. I hope to one day visit Jamaica with her.
