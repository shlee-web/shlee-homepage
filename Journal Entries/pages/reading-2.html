<h1>A Rant About Technology</h1>
<p>
With the rise of AI and how “sci-fi” technology has become, it’s easy to forget how analog items are technology too. Technology has become so scary, and it’s funny saying that since I look at a screen for a good 75 percent of the day. It doesn’t have to be a machine that runs on electricity and runs code to work an application. It can be as simple as sewing by hand or slippers. It is an interesting reading on what is considered technology or not.
